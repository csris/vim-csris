# vim-csris: My Personal Vim Preferences

`vim-csris` is a Vim 8 package that contains my personal Vim preferences.
Making this a package makes it easier to install them across different
machines instead of copying around my `.vimrc`.


## Installation

First, be sure to install Vim 8 or later. Then clone the git repo into the
right path in your home directory.

```
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack
cd ~/.vim/pack
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/csris/vim-csris.git
```
